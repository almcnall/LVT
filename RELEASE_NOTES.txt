========================================================================
Land Verification Toolkit (LVT) Public Release 7.0r (r4080:5470)
========================================================================

This patch release includes updates r4080:5464

- Merge tools/lvt/7/development into tools/lvt/7/public7.0

  These updates consist of:

  * fixes for gfortran and pointer to allocatable conversions

- Add more descriptive NetCDF prompts (thanks Shugong)

- Remove MPI from configure scripts.

- Merge tools/lvt/7/development into tools/lvt/7/public7.0

  These updates consist of:

  * documentation update

  * bug fixes to CPC precip plugin

    updated GHCN to process precip obs

    updates to the history reader to be consistent with the LIS outputs (This
    enables LVT to process ALL outputs (including Lake, RTM, SAC/VIC) from LIS).

  * added the changes to the configuration script from Eric Kemp

- Create LVT 7.0 Public branch

- Rename tools/lvt-dev to tools/lvt/7/development

- Rename tools/lvt to tools/lvt-dev

- checks to avoid diagnose errors when using binary LIS outputs

- Updates to the NLDAS-2 reader and module.

  Converted the NLDAS-2 VIC reader to the GES DISC style.
  This data is available on Discover here:
  /discover/nobackup/projects/drought/shared/NLDAS2.VIC
  The data is available at the GES DISC here:
  http://disc.sci.gsfc.nasa.gov/hydrology/data-holdings

  Added NLDAS-2 SAC datasets, including the post-processed
  SAC soil moisture on Noah levels.
  The SAC data (NCEP/EMC style) is on Discover here:
  /discover/nobackup/projects/drought/shared/NLDAS2.SAC

  The post-processed soil moisture data on Discover here:
  /discover/nobackup/projects/drought/shared/NLDAS2.SAC/SM

  The data is available at NCEP/EMC here:
  http://www.emc.ncep.noaa.gov/mmb/nldas/

  GES DISC style data for the NLDAS-2 SAC datasets are not
  yet created; once they are, this plugin will be modified.

- updated the master config file

- Added the capability to compute metrics on a basin/region scale rather
  than on a pixel-by-pixel basis. If this option is turned on, LVT expects
  the user to provide a categorical map which will then be used to
  generate the basin/region delineations

- added the capability to process

  USGS ground water well data

  Plate Boundary Observatory data (snow depth and soil moisture)

- Added the plugin to read the North American Soil Moisture Database (NASMD)
  data

- fixed a missing parameter projection initialization in LVT

- A few diagnostic checks on the LVT configuration

- updated the ALEXI plugin to support the newly obtained 4km data

- Relaxed the requirement that LIS model outputs be present at every LIS output
  interval. The user can select a LIS model output interval (in lvt.config) that
  is smaller than or equal to the LIS model output interval. LVT runs its clock
  at this interval and keeps looking for LIS output files.  

- fixed a bug that caused time series files to not work when multiple soil
  layers were enabled for looking at variables like soil moisture. 

- Modifications to support the change  in NETCDF output in LIS. Backward
  compatibility to older LIS7 outputs is also maintained. 

- bug fix to the ensemble standard deviation code

- added support to read dekadal outputs from LIS

  This implementation currently does not support temporal averaging at 
  intervals other than 'dekad'

- added the support for default options to the configure script

- Corrected the number of seconds in a year.  Because this value
  is both set and used in the code, this revision will not change
  any output.

- added support for ground water well data - not fully tested yet!

  added a check in the mean metric computations to check if observations
  are enabled. 

- Adjust LDFLAGS

  Using the new JasPer library installed on discover required reordering
  some options in the LDFLAGS variable.

- Merge NU-WRF updates into tools/lvt

  I manually merged commits r642:1752 from the trunk of the NU-WRF
  repository on progress, svn/nu-wrf/code/trunk, into LIS' tools/lvt
  branch.

  These updates consist of:

  * Modify strings within calls to register_dataEntry to appease
    the gfortran compiler.

    Note that both the IBM/AIX Fortran compiler and gfortran expect
    the individual strings defined in an array like ::

       (/"string1", "string2"/)

    to have the same length.

    For example, this is incorrect ::

       (/"kg/m2s", "kg/m2"/)

    and this is correct ::

       (/"kg/m2s", "kg/m2 "/)

  * LVT_rc%var_based_strat is an integer.  To appease the gfortran
    compiler do not check it like a logical within a conditional
    statement.

- Add JasPer library to the Config.pl configure script

  Note that the user must set an LVT_JASPER environment variable
  for the configure script to work.

- added the metric to compute percentiles for each ensemble member separately

- fixes to the restart support for percentiles and ensemble percentile
  calculations

- Added the description of the option for yearly temporal averaging
  to start at any given month into the lvt.config master file.

- Added longer possible character lengths for the
  diagnostic file and for output stats directory.

- Added option for calculating only percentiles climatology
  to the lvt.config master file, and made some formatting
  improvements.

- Corrected name of NASA AMSR-E entry in lvt.config file.

- More formatting corrections to the lvt.config master file.

- Organization and LaTeX formatting changes to the
  lvt.config master file for the LVT User's Guide.

- documentation update, small update to the grib reader 

- Adding the updated LVT usersguide to the source code

- documentation updates, updates to the NCL plotting utilities. 

- Updates to config files reflecting latest additions
  to the LVT code.

- Adding the files for GRACE plugin and Anomaly computations

- 1. Added a plugin to process GRACE observations (these are the "processed"
     GRACE observations generated by LDT
  2. Added a plugin to read and process the UW ET data
  3. Updates to the indices calculations to restart from a prescribed
     climatology
  4. Bug fix so that LVT doesn't overwrite metric calculations that require
     only one pass through the data when metric types that require two passes
     through the data are simultaneously used

- Added recent option updates made within the code to the
  sample METRICS and lvt.config.master files.  Also made
  the MODEL TBL file consistent with LIS-7's config file.
  Also updated documentation for all three files, and
  made some cosmetic changes.

- Corrected some typos of gswi to sgwi.

- added the options for restart for SRI, SPI, SSWI and percentile calculations

  Previously the code computed the climatologies and the indices all in one go.
  Now the code has an option to simply compute the climatology alone and then
  use that climatology to (in a restart mode) to find the required index eor
  any particular simulation.                                                                      
  A new metric called SGWI - standardized ground water index -- which is 
  similar to SSWI, but for TWS variable.  

- support for a number of ratio variables are added:
  1. SWE/P (snow water equivalent over precip) 
  2. ET/P  (evapotranspiration over precip)
  3. Qs/P  (surface runoff over precip)
  4. Qsb/P (subsurface runoff over precip)

  Note that the model (LIS) output should have the component variables
  in the same units. LVT do not currently do unit conversions when
  computing these ratios. 

- Change to the reader of the MOD16 dataset, so LVT will point to the
  "LE" filenames instead of the "ET" filenames.  A unit conversion is
  also performed.  This change was made so users can compare fluxes in
  W/m^2.

- added the file with the actual implementation of RFV metric

- fixed a typo in the monthly time averaging interval check

- added the river flow variate metric

- Added the ability to define the start of the year when yearly intervals
  are used in time averaging

  Added metrics for computing min, max and sum

- fix to the ARM data reader to check for array out of bounds

- Set LVT_rc%lnc(n) and LVT_rc%lnr(n) within
  utils/input_proc/readinput_polar.F90

- Set LVT_rc%lnc(n) and LVT_rc%lnr(n) within
  utils/input_proc/readinput_lambert.F90

- updates to for the fix of time averaging options

- Adding length to character strings to accomodate
  some longer path names in the lvt.config file.

  Replacing the Jan 2012 LVT User's Guide with
  the latest available version from Dec 2012.

- initial version of ALEXI reader (does not work currently)

  data plugin to read LIS DA processed observations

  bug fix for monthly/yearly averaging logic
